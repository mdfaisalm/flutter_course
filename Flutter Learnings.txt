Stateless Wisget (Required for Hot Reload)
Hot Restart (instant run but reset all views state)

6/41
Container (Can contain only one child, occupied full screen if no child, otherwise big as child| Container without Scaffold Widget holds fullscreen)
SafeArea Widget (To avoid buttons and notches,adding bar adjust top notches automatically, so no need of safearea while using appbar)
width, height of container

Card Widget
Padding Class
ListTile Widget (problem while want to set padding to 0 of all sides, so use custom widget row with 2 containers, 1 for icon other for text)
Divider Widget

7/51
Expanded Widget (just like a weight property in linear layout)(must be a descendant of a Row, Column, or Flex, and the path from the Expanded widget to its enclosing Row, Column, or Flex must contain only StatelessWidgets or StatefulWidgets (not other kinds of widgets, like RenderObjectWidgets).
only one child, flex property to set ratio, divides full with (for rows) by childs depending on ratio. default ratio is 1
in row or column only those children which are enclosed with expanded

7/52
using intention actions like bulb icon on left on selected code-line and on flutter outline panel

7/53
FlatButton (onPressed)
print (just like logcat)

7/55
Variables (String interpolation with $ eg. "abc&variable&d")

7/57
Dart is "statically typed language" means defining a variable can store only that type of data. Dynamically typed language
Dart can be used as "Dynamically typed language" by defining dynamic data type, which can be assigned any value even at the time of defining.
Dart variable var can also be used as dynamic data type by leaving un-defined at the time of definition.

7/58
Stateful (provide a method to redraw screen) vs Stateless Widget(can't change state of screen)

Arrow Functions (arrow syntax => is used when there is only one line code in calling method
,void main()=>runApp(MyApp()) is equivalent to below method
void main() {
 runApp(MyApp());
 }
 and
 int add()=>5+2;
 is equivalent to
 int add(){
 return 5+2;
 }
 and
  int add(int a,int b)=>a+b;
  is equivalent to
  int add(int a,int b){
  return a+b;
  }

10/88

Quizzer App
Import Alert Dialog flutter package

10/102
syntax sugar (assign default values in constructor without assignment operator in body)
class Question{
    String questionText;
    bool questionAnswer;

    Question (String a, bool b){
        questionText=a;
        questionAnswer=b;
    }
}

is equal to
class Question{
    String questionText;
    bool questionAnswer;

    Question (this.questionText, this.questionAnswer);
}

12/122
ThemeData
HexDecimal Colors

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
Extract Widget (Widget to a Class, Flutter Outline)
Keys (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn0EOS-ZiIc)
@required (assign to required params of method)

12/124
Immutable (can't change, final, const, stateless widget etc)
final vs const (final can be assigned runtime values(after code compiled) as (final a=Date.now()), but const can't)

12/125
font_awesome_flutter package

12/126
GestureDetector Widget (best alternative for click listener instead of TextButton to avoid extra styling like margin n padding)

12/127
Enums (use enums instead of numbers or string when more than one options for a property, to avoid confusion with numbers after long time of code, meaningful code lines)
//Without Enum
void main(){
MyCarColor myCarColor = MyCarColor();
myCarColor.setCarColor(1);
}
class MyCarColor(){
//1 for red, 2 for blue, 3 for brown
int color;
public setCarColor(int color){
this.color=color;
}
}

//With Enum
void main(){
MyCarColor myCarColor = MyCarColor();
myCarColor.setCarColor(RED);
}
class MyCarColor(){
int color;
public setCarColor(int color){
this.color=color;
}
}

enum CarColors{
RED,
BLUE,
BROWN
}

12/128
Ternary Operators
expression?then:else
age>14?young:child

12/129
Functions as parameters
void main(){
int result= calculator(5,8,add or multiple);
}

int calculator(int a,int b, Function function){
return function(a,b);
}

int add(int a,int b){
return a+b;
}

int multiply(int a,int b){
return a*b;
}

also we can name a Function as
Function calculator=(int a,int b, Function){
return calculator(a,b);
}

and another example
void main(){
Car myCar=Car(slowDrive);//setting Car function value as slowDrive at initialization
myCar.drive();//calling slowDrive method
myCar.drive=fastDrive;//changing value of drive function
myCar.drive();//calling fastDrive Method
}

class Car{
Function drive;
Car ({this.drive});
}

void slowDrive(){
print ("Slow");
}

void fastDrive(){
print ("Fast");
}

Navigator (push, pop)
Navigator.push(context,
 MaterialPageRoute(
     builder: (context){
        return screen2();
}));
Navigator.pop(context);
}

initialRoute:('/'),
routes: {
    '/':(context)=> Screen0(),
    '/screen1':(context)=> Screen1(),
    '/screen2':(context)=> Screen2(),
}
to navigate with routes use
Navigator.pushNamed(context, "/screen1");

Permissions

13/141
Duration n Sleep
Future.delayed(time, task)
Sleep is synced as it holds whole code but future just scheduler without delaying next lines of code
Async and await
Await can be applied on method returned value if method have Future as return type
Future as return type
Future is promise of something that is not ready yet just like a receipt of coffee will be offered later as ready

13/142
Stateless Widget lifecycle consist of build method
Stateful Widget lifecycle consist of (initState() to init,build() to draw, deactivate() to destroy)

13/143
to handle null you can use ?? null Aware Operator

myItems.add(DropdownMenuItem(child: Text("b"),value:"valueWhenThisItemselected"));
myItems.add(DropdownMenuItem(child: Text("c"),value:"valueWhenThisItemselected"));
String selectedItemValue="a";
DropdownButton<String>(value: selectedItemValue, items: myItems, onChanged: (value) {
selectedItemValue=value;
})

Cupertino Widgets for IOS (CupertinoPicker (onSelectedItemChanged: (selectedIndex){} called as item selection changed, children: are list of widgets and itemExtent: for height))

List<Text> myItems=[];
myItems.add(Text("a"));
myItems.add(Text("b"));
myItems.add(Text("c"));
String selectedItemValue="a";
CupertinoPicker(itemExtent:30,children:myItems, onSelectedItemChanged:(selectedIndex){
print(selectedIndex);

15/173
Hero Widget (Hero Animations, shared element transition)

15/174
Custom Animation (AnimationController(duration,vsync(context)), ticker,value) (Controller.value, controller.forward,
controller.reverse, controller.addListener to listen value changes,  controller.addStatusListener to listen state changes like completed/forward/reverse,
controller should be dismissed after as it will continue to animate after screen dismissed so use controller.dispose on dispose method of widget,
by default controller proceed numerically from 0 to 1)
Color.black.witchOpacity (for alpha)

Controller controller=AnimationController(duration: Duration(seconds:1), vsync:this);
controller.forward();//
controller.addListener((){
//setting state to update views where controller values used like below opacity
setState((){
});
}
backgroundColor: Colors.red.withOpacity(controller.value);
}

CurvedAnimation(parent: AnimationController, curve: type of curve)(for curvedAnimation, controller should be in-between of 0 and 1)

Checkbox

16/198
BottomSheet (persistent (stay on screen while user interact with other section), modal (prevent user from other part interaction,showModalBottomSheet))
open Keyboard on start of widget set autofocus:true to TextField

16/200
local state (state of a widget with constant value like Text("abc") or set value with a variable but variable is defined inside widget so it always reset on reDraw of widget)
global state (use variable for widget value and store it outside widget)

16/202
ListView can take direct list of child or if there is lot of child then should use ListViewBuilder(works like recyclerview to recycle items)
IndexedWidgetBuilder (context, index) used with ListViewBuilder
ListView.Builder(itemBuilder:(context,index){},itemCount:10)

16/204
MVC (Model, View, Controller) (View capture user requirements and send to controller, controller communicate to model for data and then update view accordingly)
Imperative vs Reactive

16/205
Provider Package for state management
define
Provider<String>(
builder: (context){
return "string";
}
child: any widget
)
use
Text(Provider.of<String>(context));//listen true/false param can set with context to listen or not to changes means just use initial value always

ChangeNotifier with Provider(notifyListeners to publish changes,ChangeNotifierProvider as parent widget)
define
ChangeNotifierProvider<Data>(
builder: (context){
return Data();
}
child: any widget
)
notifier class
class Data extends ChangeNotifier{
String data="some data";
void changeString(newValue){
data=newValue;
notifyListeners();
}
}
use
Text(Provider.of<Data>(context).data);//listen true/false param can set with context to listen or not to changes means just use initial value always
notify
Provider.of<Data>(context).changeString(newValue);

16/206
Consumer Widget (belongs to Provider package, use to remove repetition of code for access of ChangeNotifier class)
Consumer<Data>(
builder: (context,data,child){
return anyWidget(
data.blabla instead of Provider.of<Data>(context).blabla
so as data of ChangeNotifier class change data param of this class will be updated
)
}
)

Tips
For multi-language coding just focus on logic, syntex will be switched automatically in short and also auto-complete and documentation is there
Be the best in skill and be updated, don't feel about competitions, more skillful and updated will be more valuable
Portfolio helps to show world, don't tell about your skills but show your skills, and for portfolio add quality work you done and clone top apps in free time to add to portfolio
Learn side skills like git, firebase, jetpack etc...

To learn new skills, learn basics and then learn and apply and learn and apply and learn and apply in cycle according to your current goal (app/software)
Means not a need to master fully (99.99) and then start applying to projects,
just learn basics and then learn along with projects as required in current project
Don't try to store information and syntax as all is available on google, so just remember the logics and understand code instead of remembering code
Success is not overnight
Opportunities comes to those who are prepared for others just another signal to wakeup, so first get prepared, opportunities will come on there time
First reputation and then money will come automatically (on/off internet)
